To setup a new packapps server:
> Create a new Docker droplet on DO.
> Copy private key to droplet
> git pull ssh://orchestration.packercloud.com/var/git/packapps
> TODO deployment helper that generates AWS IDs, keeps track of droplet IPs, slug names etc.
> edit company name and slug in settings.yml
> point subdomain to droplet

docker exec packapps_database-server_1 sh -c 'exec mysqldump --databases operationsData growerReporting --routines --triggers --no-data -uroot -ppackapps' > output.sql
