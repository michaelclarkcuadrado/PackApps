> Create a new Docker droplet on DO.
> Copy private key to droplet
> git pull ssh://orchestration.packercloud.com/var/git/packapps
> TODO deployment helper that generates AWS IDs, keeps track of droplet IPs, slug names etc.
> edit company name and slug in packapps/application-server/src/config.php
> point subdomain to droplet
